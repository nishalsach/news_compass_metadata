# News Angle Definitions for Research Papers

Scientific papers, discoveries and events can be framed for different kinds of audiences through the use of news angles. 
Many kinds of news angles exist, and not all angles apply to all scientific papers, but some papers can have 2-3 applicable news angles. 
Not all papers will have a news angle, most papers will not have a news angle.
Science journalists look for such news angles when reading papers to determine whether a paper is newsworthy, and whether it can lend itself to a news angle they are interest in. Below are some examples of common news angles used to frame science news stories.

BROAD_IMPACT: Research that could affect large numbers of people in society.
CONTROVERSY: Research that addresses or is likely to spark public controversy or conflicting opinions
UNEXPECTEDNESS: Results that defy expectations or overturn prior assumptions.
ASTONISHMENT: Research that causes amazed reactions (“Aah!”), such as being anomalous or quirky work, or dealing with some superlative (e.g., largest, fastest).
BREAKTHROUGH: Research that makes a big breakthrough in a long-standing or persistent problem faced by researchers, or provides a drastically different way of doing science than before. Most science is incremental, very few papers are real breakthroughs.
ECONOMIC_RELEVANCE: Research that demonstrates strong commercial potential, industry application, or economic consequence.
POLICY_RELEVANCE: Research that has strong and obvious implications for regulation, governance, or social policy.
ENVIRONMENTAL_RELEVANCE: Research with consequences for climate, ecology, or sustainability.
COMMUNITY_IMPACT: Research that extremely specific communities (e.g., a local, professional, or underrepresented community) may be impacted by.
GOOD_NEWS: The results present some really good news that readers would feel positively after reading.
BAD_NEWS: The results present some really bad news that could create negative feelings after reading.
